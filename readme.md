# CPSC 5130 Final Project

-----------
Hospital.java is the final project for CPSC 5130. 
The program is connected to a MySQL database, and it allows users
to retrieve pre-made SQL queries by entering key code associated 
with each query.

## Getting Started

-----------------
### Connecting to MySQL
- Connect to MySQL database with Database Navigator Plugin in IntelliJ IDEA


### Executing program
- Once the program starts, it prints out a list of queries with
a key code associated with each query. 
- After that, it prompts the user to enter a key code. If the user enters 
a valid code as specified in the list, the result of the query that 
is associated with the entered code will be printed. 
- If the user enters an invalid code, the system will prompt the user
to enter a valid code.
- The program allows user keep entering code until the program is
ended by the user.


### Ending Program
- Input "exit" to end the program.
